			<p style="text-align:left;"><b>1.</b>Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are a major contributor to climate change and global warming.
			<br> They are produced by the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas,which are used to power transportation<br>
			 ,electricity generation, and other activities.Ride pooling, also known as carpooling, is a form of transportation in which<br> multiple passengers share a ride in a single vehicle. This can help reduce the number of vehicles on the road, which in <br>
			 turn reduces CO2 emissions by reducing the total distance traveled by vehicles. By sharing a ride, passengers can reduce <br>
			 the number of trips taken, which can lead to lower fuel consumption and fewer emissions per person.

			<p> <b>2.Plants are beneficial to us in a variety of ways<br>. Plants offer seeds such as wheat, rice, corn, and other<br>
				foods that we consume on a daily basis. <br>Plants provide us with oxygen and take in the carbon dioxide that we release. This helps maintain a balance in the ecosystem and reduces global warming.</b>
